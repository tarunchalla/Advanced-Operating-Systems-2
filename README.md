Advanced Operating Systems 2


CS 6378: Project III
Instructor: Ravi Prakash
Assigned on: April 9, 2013
Due date: April 30, 2013
This is an individual project and you are expected to demonstrate its operation either to the instructor or the TA.
You are required to implement the following tree-based voting protocol for replica consistency. Let there be
seven servers, S0; S1; S2; : : : S6, that maintain replicas of data objects. The seven servers are logically arranged as a
balanced binary tree as shown in Section 6. There are four data objects, D0; D1; : : : ;D3 of type integer. Each server
maintains copies of the four data objects, along with their version number. Initially, all the replicas are consistent, with
Dj initialized to 3 ô€€€ j with version number equal to 1, where 0  j  3. There are five clients, C0; C1; : : : ;C4. All
communication channels are FIFO.
The protocol for data access is as follows:
1. When a client, Ci wishes to access a data object Dj ,1 it sends a request of the form REQUEST(Ci, Dj , v) to all
seven servers in the logical tree and starts an AWAITING GRANT timer. The purpose of this access operation
is to add v to the current value of Dj , where v is an integer. The value of the AWAITING GRANT timer is
equal to 20 time units (given in the config file in Section 6).
2. A server can grant only one request at a time for a data object. If a server has not granted any request for that
data object when it receives Ciâ€™s request, then the server sends a GRANT message to Ci and enters a blocked
state corresponding to that object. Subsequent requests received by the server for the same object, while it is
blocked by Ci, are placed by the server in a queue corresponding to that object.
3. If client Ciâ€™s request has been granted by the tree of servers before the expiry of its AWAITING GRANT timer
then the client does the following: (i) first Ci waits for a period of time referred to as the HOLD TIME, then (ii)
client Ci sends a COMMIT message to all servers. The HOLD TIME is equal to 1 time unit. Granting of the
request by the tree is recursively defined as:
(a) The request has been granted by the root of the tree, and either the left or the right subtree, OR
(b) The request has been granted by the left subtree and the right subtree.
If a subtree has only one server, then the granting of request by that subtree is equivalent to obtaining a grant
from that server.
4. On receiving the COMMIT message from Ci, all the servers perform the operation indicated in the corresponding
REQUEST message, increment the version number of the targeted data object by one, send an ACK to
Ci, and remove Ciâ€™s request from their queue. If the server was blocked by Ciâ€™s request then the server gets
unblocked on performing the data update operation. Now, it can grant the request at the head of the queue of
pending requests for the newly updated object.
5. If a requesting clientâ€™s AWAITING GRANT timer expires before it receives permission from the tree then the
client withdraws its request by sending a corresponding WITHDRAW message to all servers, and increments
the number of unsuccessful accesses by one. The variable to store the number of unsuccessful accesses is
maintained locally at each client, and is initialized to zero.
6. On receiving a WITHDRAW message from Ci, servers perform the same operation as on receiving the COMMIT
message, except for performing the access operation.
1For simplicity we consider all accesses to be write operations.

If you believe that this protocol may result in writes to a data object being performed at different servers in different
order, add safeguards to prevent such a possibility.
1 Simulating Failure and Recovery
Client C0 has the special ability to selectively deactivate and reactivate servers. This capability will be used to simulate
failure and subsequent recovery of servers. C0 will send the deactivate and reactivate messages to server(s) only when
it is not trying to access a data object. The following messages will be used for this purpose:
 DEACTIVATE(Si): When this message, sent by C0, is received by server Si the server empties all its queues,
and silently discards all other messages until it receives a REACTIVATE message.
 REACTIVATE(Si): When this message, sent by C0, is received by server Si the server should poll other servers
to get the latest values of all the data objects from the live servers, update its copies of the data objects to reflect
this information, and resumes participating in the voting and data update operations. You need to design and
implement a protocol for the recovering server to obtain the latest values from the live servers.
2 Operation with No Failure
1. A client can have at most one pending access request at a time. The time between the completion (successful
or unsuccessful) of the previous access and the next access attempted by a client is uniformly distributed in the
range [5,10] time units. Use the same distribution for the initial access. When a client wishes to perform an
update, it arbitrarily selects one of the four data objects for the update and initiates the protocol as described
above.
2. In your experiments all communication should be performed using IP stream sockets.
3. Execute your experiment until a total of M updates have been attempted.
4. Repeat the experiment with the HOLD TIME set to 0:1, 0:5, 1:5, 2:0, and 5:0 time units.
3 Operation with Failure and Recovery
1. After client C0 has completed M
5 (successful + unsuccessful) update operations it sends DEACTIVATE messages
to servers listed in the config file (see Section 6).
2. After client C0 has completed 2M
5 (successful + unsuccessful) update operations it sends REACTIVATE messages
to the same set of servers.
4 Data Collection
For each experiment report the following:
1. The number of successful and unsuccessful accesses by each client.
2. The total number of messages exchanged.
3. For the successful accesses, the minimum, maximum, average, and standard deviation of the time between
issuing an access request and receiving permission from the server tree.
4. For every data object, do all replicas of the object go through exactly the same sequence of updates?
5. What is the impact, if any, of the value of HOLD TIME on the performance of the protocol?
